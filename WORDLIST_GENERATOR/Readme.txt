Within the framework of this project, I have developed a highly efficient wordlist generation tool intended for use in potential brute force attacks. It is essential to note that the resultant wordlist file may become substantial depending on the chosen word length range.

By employing this tool, you can significantly optimize the process of cracking passwords without the need to repeatedly generate words during each cracking attempt. The generated wordlist can be directly utilized with the cracking tool, thereby conserving valuable time and processing power.

To operate the tool, follow these steps:

    1. Execute the program using the command "python3 wordlist_generator.py."
    2. Input the desired minimum and maximum word lengths for the wordlist.

The program will then display the number of words successfully generated, and an associated .txt file will be preserved, containing all the words in the wordlist.
