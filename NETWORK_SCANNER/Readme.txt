In the context of this project, a highly advanced tool has been meticulously developed to conduct network scans, aiming to identify and retrieve information about accessible devices with their associated MAC addresses.

To initiate the scan, the user is required to provide the specific IP address of the target network, exemplified as 192.168.1.1/24. Subsequently, the Python program will systematically explore the network, methodically compiling an exhaustive inventory of IP addresses along with their corresponding MAC addresses.
